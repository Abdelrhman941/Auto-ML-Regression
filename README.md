# Auto-ML-Regression-Classification

## Overview  
This repository provides an automated framework for **regression** and **classification** tasks using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
It allows users to input a dataset, perform preprocessing, train models, and generate detailed plots for analysisâ€”all with minimal manual intervention.

## Features  
- **Automated Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encoding, and scaling.  
- **Regression Models**: Includes multiple regression algorithms with evaluation metrics.  
- **Classification Models**: Supports various classifiers with accuracy reports.  
- **Visualization**: Generates key plots for model performance analysis.  
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Structured, reusable, and scalable implementation.
